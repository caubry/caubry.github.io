### Back to Unity3d ###

I've recently being out of work and while seeking new opportunities, I came to the realisation that most of the game startups out there these days, work with *Unity3d*. 
As such, I thought it might be a very good time to refresh my memory with this tool and adapt the knowledge I have gained as a professional developer into the creation of some *super cool* Unity games. In fact, I've used Unity3d in the past during my Bachelor degree, but didn't get a chance to work with it ever again.

While I've been keeping myself very busy for the past two weeks, working on my university courseworks, - [OpenGL](http://carolineaubry.com/openglsonic/) and [Bullet Physics Engine](http://carolineaubry.com/bulletboids/) - going to interviews, answering the phone :O ... I thought it would be great to only focus on learning Unity - as well as pursuing my job search of course :)

### 48H Game Challenge ###
So that's it for the background story! Time to talk about what I've been doing and what I'm going to do. I am currently looking at increasing my portfolio size and demonstrate that I am capable to work with various genres. In that sense, I set myself a challenge that I like to call the *48 hours game challenge*. 
As I want to quickly progress in the learning of Unity, I thought it could be a fun and interesting challenge to set to myself.

So here comes the first game that I've made under 15 hours; the remake of MineSweeper. While I am very keen on working on a different project, I believe it would be a great idea to create some template code that I could reuse for different games. As such, I'm currently working on level management :)
