### EGX Rezzed 2015 - London ###

I've had an amazing time at the EGX Rezzed 2015 in London and I'm definetely up to go there again next year. This post is just to show you what happened during this day and hopefully give you a reason to go there next year :)

Unfortunately, I didn't have time to play every single game, as I believe the event holded something like 50+ games. I however had the chance to liaise with some independant developers and had the pleasure to discover their very unique games.

The first game I played at the event is named Sky Scrappers and it's a great multi-player platformer. After some googling I found this Youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyVZvlpNbkc) interviewing the team and showing the gameplay.

The flame in the flood. Survival adventure with a strong narrative.
