### EGX Rezzed 2015 - London ###

I've had an amazing time at the EGX Rezzed 2015 in London and I'm definetely up to go there again next year. This post is just to show you what happened during this day and hopefully give you a reason to go there next year :)

Unfortunately, I didn't have time to play every single game, as I believe the event holded something like 50+ games. I however had the chance to liaise with some independant developers and had the pleasure to discover their very unique games.

The first game I played at the event is named **Sky Scrappers** and it's a great multi-player platformer. After some googling I found this Youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyVZvlpNbkc) interviewing the team and showing the gameplay.

I already owe this game named **the Escapists** on Xbox One, but I wanted to check out the booth. Suprisely, I had the pleasure to talk to Chris Dave, the guy behind the title. He explained to me that he created the PC version using Fusion before Team 17 shown interest and redesigned the title a little in order to publish it on Xbox One :)

I played this survival adventure game named **The flame in the flood** created by The Molasses Flood, for a good fifteen minutes. I really enjoyed the music and the strong narrative behind the title. This is clearly my type of game and I would probably end up buying it :) Again, after a little bit of googling I found their [Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/molassesflood/the-flame-in-the-flood)!

**Maia** is a very interesting and promising title. I played this title for about 20 minutes, less than the average player with a 50 minutes on the clock :S I enjoyed creating my station somewhere within an unknown galaxy and been given instructions by Simon Roth, the creator. Be careful when playing this game as there are a lot of jokes. So stay straight and enjoy it! :D The team have a [website](http://maiagame.com/) so check it out :)

I've only had a quick glance at this game named **Mushroom 11** and I was very intrigued by the artwork and the gameplay. I wish the queue was smaller at that time :) More information can be found on their [page](http://mushroom11.com/).

Amazing alpha version of **RPG Tycoon** and it is already available on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/314240/). I do love my tycoons and I always enjoy building as well as destroying a population. Adding the RPG style makes it a perfect combination. The only downside it's that I didn't save my progression. Definetely a must owe game :)

Some amazing tech were being showcased on that day. [**Roto VR**](http://invisioncommunity.co.uk/2015/03/16/rezzed-2015-first-look-at-roto-vr/) was one of them. This tech looked amazing and a lot of people seemed to have great fun with it. Unfortunately the waiting time was somewhere between one to two hours and I couldn't afford the miss out on the developer sessions :(

Which leads me to talk about these developer sessions. I've only attended two of them, with **Guild Wars 2 - Heart of thorns** and **Life is Strange 2**.

While I've never had a chance yet to play on Life is Strange, I found this developer session interesting. Life is Strange, created by Dontnod Entertainment is an interactive game where the choices you make will have direct impact on the narrative. During this session and with Aoife Wilson as animator, the audience was involved in the decision making of the second episode of the series. After the showcase of this episode, the audience could ask questions to the lead developer himself, with questions from to the sounds to the set of the scene.

One of the reason I wanted to go the Rezzed event was to hear about one of my favourite game, **Guild Wars 2**. Unfortunately I do not play PVP that much and I'm usually more into PVE. That said, I truly enjoyed the talk regarding the new extension for the PVP world as well as discovering the new sceneries and game mechanics. I might even try to play a little bit more of PVP with this upcoming extension :)

At the very end of the day, I had the pleasure to check out the demos of the Creative Assembly Game jamers. The teams could pick between three themes from gas prices, Jeremy Clarkson to Terry Pratchers. They've only had around 10 hours to create a game and they were all in one way or another, very impressive.

And finally I didn't leave alone on that day... Meet my new friend Dave!
