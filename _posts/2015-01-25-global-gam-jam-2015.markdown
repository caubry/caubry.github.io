###Global Game Jam 2015 - London

![Run for cream](/images/runforcreamscreen.png "Run for cream")

I've just come back from the Global Game Jam 2015 event in London and I'm exhausted.   
This gaming hackathon allowed my team and I to create a local multi-player game between Friday 5pm and today, Sunday 5pm.   
So here is what we managed to achieve within this time frame:   

###Run For Cream by the Angry Tigers team

The aim of is to grab the ice cream before your friends! You can use gamepads or the keyboard, up to 4 players. 

The technology that we've used to create this game is Haxe in conjuction with Flixel, also known as HaxeFlixel.
We first thought of using ActionScript 3 with the framework Flixel, but as we wanted to use the control pad and allow the game to be crossed platform, we decided to go with Haxe; a first for myself, as well as the second programmer :]
