  <h3>Project description</h3>
  <p>This project uses the <a href="http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress">Bullet Physics engine</a> and implement an AI algorithm illustrating flocking.
  Three simple steering behaviours have to be applied to describe how an individual boid maneuvers: <strong>separation</strong>, <strong>alignment</strong> and <strong>cohesion</strong>. Regarding the bird behaviours, three physical principles have been followed: <strong>thurst</strong>, <strong>lift</strong> and <strong>drag</strong>.
  <p>Furthermore, the flock is always trying to avoid static obstacles placed across the world, while the camera is finding the leader of the flock in order to follow it.</p>
